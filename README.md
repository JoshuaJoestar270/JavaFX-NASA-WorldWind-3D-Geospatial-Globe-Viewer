# JavaFX-NASA-WorldWind-3D-Geospatial-Globe-Viewer
Developed an interactive 3D globe viewer desktop application using JavaFX for the UI and NASA WorldWind Java SDK for geospatial rendering.
Embedded the WorldWind canvas in a JavaFX window via SwingNode for cross-platform compatibility.
Implemented core features: dynamic globe display with terrain/imagery layers, zoom/pan controls, placemark markers with tooltips, and a sample WMS (Web Map Service) layer integration (NASA Blue Marble satellite imagery).
Configured initial view (latitude/longitude/altitude), added atmospheric effects, and handled basic renderable layers.
Demonstrates proficiency in Java, JavaFX UI development, geospatial SDK integration, multi-threaded rendering considerations, and NASA WorldWind/OGC standards exploration—directly relevant to GIS and mapping applications.

Tech Stack: Java, JavaFX, NASA WorldWind Java SDK, SwingNode
